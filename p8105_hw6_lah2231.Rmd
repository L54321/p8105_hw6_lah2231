# Problem 2

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
homicide_data <- read.csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
#View(homicide_data)
```

```{r}
head(homicide_data)
```

## Preparing Data
```{r}
prepared_homicide_data <- 
  homicide_data |>
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) |>
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    !is.na(victim_age)
  )
#View(prepared_homicide_data)
```

I created city_state and resolved, converted victim_age to numeric, omitted specific cities, and limited to White/Black races. I excluded the lines without known ages.
